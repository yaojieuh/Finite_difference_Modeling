This is the finite difference modeing code
Input parameters are
	nx      	The dimension of the x direction
	nz		The dimension of the z direction
	dx		The stepsize of the x direction
	dz		The stepsize of the z direction
	ne		THe grid point of the absorb boundary condtion at each side
	nt		THe number of the time step
	dt		The stepsize of the time
	f0		The dominat frequency of the wavelet (default: Ricker)
	veloread	The index of generating or reading velocity from file (0: generating layer modeling by code)
	file_v0		The name of the velocity binary file (the first direction:z)
	nbsou		THe number of source 
	nbrec		The number of reciver (for each shot, it is evenly at each side of the source)
	file_sou	THe file to read the source position

Output:
	test_trace_...	The binary file of the whole shot
